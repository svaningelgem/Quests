#### 💬 Discord
**This is the preferred method for general questions about Quests or the development of the project**. There is no dedicated support team, rather a team of volunteers (myself) who can help only when they have time.

#### 🌐 Language
Please speak English and do not use any vulgar or harmful language. We work on this project in our free time, getting mad at us, making demands, or just complaining in general will not achieve anything.
